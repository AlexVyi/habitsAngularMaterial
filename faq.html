                                Ok, lets get the big question out of the way first.
                                What makes us different from all the other apps, which are more oriented towards being todo lists, is the fact that our main focus is building positive habbits and removing negative ones rather than presenting tasks on a day to day basis.
                                Our point system is constructed in such a way, that it's most rewarding to have a few goals and stick to them, rather than having a lot and not committing/sticking to them only every once in a while.

                                <h4>Overview</h4>
                                <p>The app has two main purposes. Get rid of the negative habits that stand in your way, and form new ones,positive habits, that help you succeed. To do this it uses a reward system based on points, which is designed in a way that lets you easily track your progress. Because you're unique the app is highly customizable and you can tailor you habits schedule, to be the best fit for you.
                                </p>
                                <br><h4>How do I get rid of bad habits?</h4><p>In order to remove a bad habit you add it to your goal as a Don't (for example: Don't bite your fingernails!) and decide how many points this goal is worth (let's say 500). Now, each time you bite your nails you're supposed to click the little box next to this goal. Once you click it you lose the amount of points you've commited (in this case 500). Stick to your plan and don't fall back into this habit anymore and you will have a nice surprise (what it is exactly is a secret ;) )</p>
                                <br><h4>How do I form a positive habit?</h4>
                                <p> So you wish to improve yourself, great. Here is how we can help: Add the habit, set a timeframe for it (daily, weekly or monthly) and set a number of repeats per timeframe, for example, if you wish to get into shape you might add something like jog, weekly 3 times, which means that you commit to jogging <b>at least</b> three times a week (overachievers are welcome and get rewarded by merit). If you don't stick to your new formed habit (let's say that in a week you only jog twice) you lose points. On the other hand, if you stick to your word and put in the work you'll be rewarded at the end of the day, week or month (depending on the timeframe you set).</p>
                                <p>You lose points if you fulfill a don't. You also lose points if you do not stick to your goals.</p>

                                Dailys are worth 500, weeklies 1000 and monthlies 3000 for each repeat. If you don't fulfill them you lose the same amount of points for each unfulfilled repeat. You only get points if you fulfill all repeats. For example if you set a habit of exercising three times a week and exercise three times, you get 3X1000=3000 points. If you only exercise twice you lose 1000 points( for being 1 repeat short of a weekly you lose 1X1000 points).

                                <p>Yes you can. If you overachive you get half the point you would normally get for a repeat. This measure is meant to otivate you to set you goals higher if you notice that you frequently overachive.
                                <p> Using the same example as above, if you exercise 4 times during a week you get 3X100=3000 for fulfilling your goal and 1X500=500 for overachieving by 1.

Like we've already said, you'll always have the choise of not giving money when not fulfilling a goal, even if you have monetized your goals. It's just an additional tool you can use if you feel like you need help sticking to your goals.</p>
                                <p>Also, no one's asking you to pledge huge sums (even though we wouldn't stop you), but you'd be surprised, what a great psychological difference it makes to pledge a dollar or even 50 cents to your goal. We promise you'll feel the difference!</p>
